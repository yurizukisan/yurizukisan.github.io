when i enter real world, i must drink a red pill. real world consists of nodes that give me problems i should resolve for me and edges that gives me restrictions i want to be free from. i feel that nodes themselves bring me things i do not see, e.g. fact that i am alone in real world and probably ever, fact that i am estimated by everyone that i do not have good anything. nodes effect because they exist. edges put me down on rocks and deny for me to be free. edges are better than nodes since nodes do not give me possibilities to go away but edges allow to exit from them. i can not deny effects from men but i can go away from relationships. in actual problems as possibility to resolve, no problems at men, there problems at relationships.

when i drink blue pill in real world, i zone to internet. though real world supports internet physically, internet consists of non-physical things with analogy to that a body gives basement of consiousness but consiousness consists of what can not recognize except to feel. normally, internet responses from requests i offer so that internet gives things needed by me. this restriction makes self-ended world so allow me to drink blue pill and to not drink red pill.

there things happen that blue pills are spreading to places red pills covered. it is going to end that real world supports internet. realtime accessibility gives possibility for men to belong in internet ever. red pill market is shutting down by blue pill market. i can say that internet supports real world. but this quasi-fact gives new possible problem to me: internet to be real world. this may be bad thing for me. im afraid that no exits in the two worlds. it should be that real world is non-acceptable and internet is acceptable.
