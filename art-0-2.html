suppose that somebody says you are in wrong way or somebody affects you to recognize your wrong things. then you may he denies you. his voice, his eyes, his face or his existence gives you to feel denied. you may feel no you are need by someone at all. relationships are constructed not only when you meet somebody but also when you are there. somebody recognize you with no consiousness. existence gives effects somebody with just you are. this "existence" does not need to exists physically. it is good to say that "recognization" gives effects somebody. but if somebody does not recognize you consiousnessly, you exists in his mind. relationships are if you are. the problem is when somebody deny you explicitly or implicitly. in result, that he denies you is that he recognizes you. this recognizing is not at bad meaning. even if he denies your existence, you are there. and you are there, his mind.

think otherwise. tha is the case you are not denied or recognized from anybodies. exactly, it is when you feel you are not regconized from anybodies. i think this is the essential case with aspect to living in society. aloneness is a factor. aloneness itself is not always at bad meaning. aloneness may give you possibility to live strongly and live to be free. someone likes to live with only himself. even if you are alone, somebody will deny your existence. it is "you".
<h2 id="self-denying-also-proves-your-existence">self-denying also proves your existence</h2>

even if you deny you, your existence are there. though it may cause your pain, your pain proves your existence. when you do not deny you, it will be happy case. but when you do not recognize you, it will be the most bad case. denying you is that there is hope to you, but no is no hope. do not forget that denying you proves your existence.
